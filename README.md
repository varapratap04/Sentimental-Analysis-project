* Features

- *Data Preprocessing*: Clean and prepare the dataset for training.
- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Visualize and understand the data.
- *Model Training*: Train machine learning models on the dataset.
- *Model Evaluation*: Evaluate the performance of the models.
- *Predictions*: Use the trained models to make predictions on new data.

* Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information related to restaurant operations. It may include data on customer visits, menu items, sales, etc. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to use and share the dataset.

## ðŸ›  Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- A Google account to use Google Colab.
- Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning.

### Steps

1. *Clone the Repository:*

   sh
   git clone https://github.com/varapratap04/Sentimental-Analysis-project

2. *Open Google Colab:*

   Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account.

3. *Upload the Notebook:*

   Upload the Jupyter notebook file (restaurant_ml_project.ipynb) to Google Colab.

4. *Install Required Libraries:*

   Ensure you install the required libraries. You can do this by running the following command in a Colab cell:

   python
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   

##  Usage

1. *Load the Dataset:*

   Upload your dataset to Google Colab and load it into the notebook. You can use pandas to load the dataset:

   python
   import pandas as pd

   df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset.csv')
   

2. *Run the Notebook:*

   Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially. The notebook is divided into sections for data preprocessing, EDA, model training, evaluation, and predictions.

3. *Save Results:*

   Save the results and model outputs as needed. You can download the results from Colab to your local machine.
